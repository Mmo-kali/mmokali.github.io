### [Project 1 link: Vulnerability Management(Nessus)](https://mycyberstudies.blogspot.com/2023/01/Nessus-Vulnerability-Management.html)

• Installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts

• Implemented Vulnerability Management Function on sandbox networks:
-Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify

• Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus; remediated vulnerabilities

### [Project 2 link: Active Directory Home Lab](https://mycyberstudies.blogspot.com/2023/01/active-directory-home-lab.html)

• Active Directory Administration on Server 2019: Provisioning, Maintaining, and Deprovisioning user accounts

• Implementation and maintenance of Windows DNS and DHCP services

### [Project 3 link: Keylogger-Advanced](https://github.com/OrlandoCompC/Keylogger-Advanced)
• Developed a Python keylogger that captures all keys typed by the user and writes them to a file

• Created a feature that collects computer information and writes it to a separate file

• Implemented encryption for the keylogger's output files to ensure data security

• Created a program to decrypt files encrypted by the Python keylogger

### [Project 4 link: Palindrome Word Checker in 8086 Assembly](https://github.com/OrlandoCompC/Palindrome_Sentence_Check)
• Developed an assembly language program that checks whether a given word entered by the user is a palindrome or not

• Utilized memory addressing and comparison operations to identify palindrome words within the input string

• Employed conditional jumps and looping structures for effective character comparison and traversal

• Utilized iterative processes to analyze and compare characters in the input string for palindrome identification

• The program accurately counted and displayed the number of palindrome words found within the input sentence.

### [Project 5 Link: Encrypt and Decrypt in 8086 Assembly](https://github.com/OrlandoCompC/8086-Encryption-of-Word)
• Developed an assembly program in 8086 architecture to encrypt and decrypt user-input strings based on a specified key value.

• Leverages memory manipulation to read user input, encrypt, and decrypt strings.

• Employs XOR operations with a specific key value to transform characters for encryption and decryption.

• Prints both the encrypted and decrypted versions of the input string for user verification.
